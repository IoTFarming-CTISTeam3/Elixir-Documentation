    - Coding standard(s) somewhat complied (1 Point)
    - Coding standard(s) complied (2 Points)

- Individual Grading **(40 Points)**
  - Assignments **(20 Points)** (Ongoing, at least 5 meetings)
    - Project supervisor gives assignments to each student. Each student should contribute directly to product development by coding, Web design, animation, etc.). Only writing test cases or user’s manual is not sufficient.
